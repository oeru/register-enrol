# register-enrol
A plugin allowing learners to register (as WP users) and (un)enrol in OERu courses (subsites).

## Plugin Purpose

The [OERu](https://oeru.org) offers tertiary (university) level online courses (each course is a subsite of the OERu's [course.oeru.org](https://course.oeru.org) WordPress multisite) for learners, who can participate either anonymously or (for their own benefit) as registered WordPress users.

Registered users can choose to formally enrol in one or more OERu courses.

Being registered confers benefits like proof of participation, maintenance of "state", e.g. previously filled in form values (i.e. via session variables), as well as more social benefits like being able to post messages to fellow learners via individual course 'WEnotes Feed' pages or register a personal blog feed to be scanned for course-related posts.

This plugin provides streamlined services to allow a learner who wants to register for the Course site to do so, and then, as an authenticated (logged in) WordPress user, gives them the ability to easily enrol (or unenrol) in any of  our catalogue of courses.
